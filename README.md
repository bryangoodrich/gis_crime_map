# Crime Mapping with R and Google

During 2012-2013, I had taken on a number of open-source focused projects (dubbed "the open web") relating to my GIS degree. This one directly fueled my [Open GIS](https://github.com/bryangoodrich/open_GIS) final project (advanced GIS database management). 

In this early work, I used R, an R Google mapping API, and a little web scrapping, to get access to some local crime statistics and visualize them spatially. 

I leave these code here as a proof-of-concept for pedogogical reasons. I doubt any of the dependancies exist

* Are the data still where they were located?
* Does the Google API work in the same way?
* Does the R package still maintained?

Let this simply encourage you to make modern efforts of your own, utilizing open-source technologies and freely available data where you can. That spirit drove my creativity, and I hope these might inspire others.
